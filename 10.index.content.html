        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I am a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China. I'm in a good scholastsic standing, as well as passionate about my work. Currently I'm working at Microsoft Research Asia as a research intern.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in Computer Network and System, as well as Parallel Computing. And I have several research and project experiences in the relevant area. As a motivated practitioner, I believe these experiences contribute directly to my ability of various aspects.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I'd like to live my life in an alternative way. I am good at photography, with concerns about how to freeze time into a single frame. And I really enjoy immerse myself into music world, especially with illusions created by New-Age and Post-Rock. I believe art will help myself stay peace and have a better understanding of my life.</p>
